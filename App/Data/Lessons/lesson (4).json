  "body": "Title: Introduction to Scratch Coding\n\nInstructions: \n\n1. Familiarize yourself with the Scratch interface. Spend 10 minutes exploring the different options and features.\n\n2. Create a simple animation: Using Scratch's sprite library, select a character and make it move across the screen. Add sound effects or change the backdrop for extra creativity.\n\n3. Write a code: Create a simple program that requires user interaction. For example, make the sprite say \"Hello\" when clicked or change color when a specific key is pressed.\n\n4. Challenge mode: Experiment with loops and conditionals. Add a loop to make your sprite repeat a certain action, such as moving up and down. Explore conditional statements like \"if-then-else\" to add interaction based on certain conditions.\n\n5. Reflect and share: Write a short paragraph about your favorite part of working with Scratch and share your project with the class.\n\nNote: Remember to save your work and be ready to present your completed project in the next class. Have fun exploring the world of Scratch coding!"
