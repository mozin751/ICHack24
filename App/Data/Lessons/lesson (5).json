  "body": "Create a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print \"Fizz\" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print \"Buzz\" instead. If a number is both a multiple of 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\". Your solution should be efficient and flexible, allowing easy changes to the range of numbers or the words used. Test your program to ensure it produces the correct output. Provide both the code and a brief explanation of how it works."
